# RelevantCode

This repository is a curated collection of tools, scripts, and templates that I’ve either created or found useful over time. They span across AutoCAD automation, Excel macros, financial tools, project planning spreadsheets, and system utilities — mostly tailored for construction, planning, and engineering workflows.

Feel free to explore, adapt, and contribute.
